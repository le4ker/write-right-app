This folder contains the SQLite database file, a sample of about 40.000 words and a C source file
that builds a query which can be run in an empty database and populate it.

Run
	gcc -o build_query build_query
and then
	head -n <number of desired words to insert> words.txt |  ./build_query > query.txt

The words.txt contains the top 40.000 commonly used words in United States, according to a research that
a related organization did (don't remember its name, I will update the current readme with its name in the future).
The words.txt file contains some data that I don't need, so the build_query also ignores these data in order to create the query.

For more information about the database contact me at my personal email.
